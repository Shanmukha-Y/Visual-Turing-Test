              In recent years, methods based on Artificial Intelligence (AI)
              have been increasingly employed to assist human radiologists in
              diagnosing patient images for pathologies, such as cancerous
              tumors or cardiac deficiencies. In this study we look into images
              obtained through medical scanning via X-ray Computed Tomography
              which produces cross sectional images of the body’s interior, such
              as the one shown below.

              Just like human radiologists, AI-based methods also require
              training by letting it “see” a great diversity of human images and
              pathologies. And in order to make the AI as robust and effective
              as possible, an abundance of training images is needed -- the more
              images the better.

            <p className="tracking-wide w-[50rem] text-gray-800 text-lg lg:leading-8">
              We have devised an algorithm which can generate synthetic images
              to boost the diversity of images that can be used for AI training,
              AI verification and AI testing. In the following we will show you
              a set of medical images, one at a time, and you will be asked
              whether you think they came from a human scan (real) or were
              generated from our algorithm (fake). If you think an image was
              algorithmically generated (fake) you will be asked how fake do you think the image is? 
              Is it Clearly Fake? Somewhat Real? or Almost Real?

              Real and simulated images will be presented in random order, and
              you will be able to opt out at any time. No information will be
              collected that can link you to the responses you gave or that you
              participated in this study.

              The below are a few typical CT slice images of a chest study. You

              In the following you will see a series of images, one at a time,
              and you will need to decide whether the image is real or
              algorithmically generated. The screen will look like this:

              Now you would select "Real" or "Fake" based on your opininon of the image shown. If you select "Fake" 
              please notice the sub question asking you to choose an option that tells how fake the image looks like. 
              Once you are sure of your choices you can click the "Submit" button which will change the screen to the next image. 
              The progress bar on the right of the image informs you how many images are still
              left for you to rate. In the end you will be asked to tell us your level of expertise with medical radiology 
              and a "Finish" button will be available to complete the study. Upon clicking "Finish" wait for 2 seconds to see that 
              a completion message is now displayed to you. If you wish to do the study once again, click on the "Go to Home" button 
              and start the test again.
